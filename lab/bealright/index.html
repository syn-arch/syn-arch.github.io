            [00:00.00]I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
            [00:05.00]You look away from me, and I see there's something you're trying to hide, and I
            [00:09.50]Reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
            [00:13.00]And I wonder what's on your mind
            [00:18.00]And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
            [00:22.00]You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break, you say
            [00:26.00]The cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's, they were my mate's
            [00:30.00]And I feel the color draining from my face
            [00:35.00]And my friend said
            [00:37.00]"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
            [00:41.00]It doesn't matter, put the phone away
            [00:45.00]It's never easy to walk away, let her go
            [00:52.00]It'll be alright"
            [00:54.00]So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
            [00:57.50]And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
            [01:02.00]And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
            [01:06.00]And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
            [01:10.50]But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
            [01:14.00]It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
            [01:19.00]And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
            [01:23.00]But I just want to stay
            [01:25.40]And my friend said
            [01:27.40]"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
            [01:32.00]It doesn't matter, put the phone away
            [01:36.00]It's never easy to walk away, let her go
            [01:42.00]It'll be okay
            [01:44.50]It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
            [01:48.00]So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
            [01:53.00]You'll find another and you'll be just fine
            [01:56.00]Let her go"
            [02:01.00]But nothing heals the past like time
            [02:10.00]And they can't steal
            [02:14.00]The love you're born to find
            [02:17.00]But nothing heals the past like time
            [02:26.00]And they can't steal
            [02:30.00]The love you're born to find
            [02:37.00]I know you love her, but it's over, mate
            [02:41.00]It doesn't matter, put the phone away
            [02:45.00]It's never easy to walk away, let her go
            [02:52.00]It'll be alright..
            [02:54.00]~Thank You~
